# Parser

This test should not take you longer than two hours to complete.

What we are looking for: functionality, efficiency, readability and tests
Use this test to demonstrate your understanding of OO and TDD.


1. ruby_app

Write a ruby script that:

a. Receives a log as argument (webserver.log is provided)
  e.g.: ./parser.rb webserver.log

b. Returns the following:

  > list of webpages with most page views ordered from most pages views to less page views
     e.g.:
         /home 90 visits
         /index 80 visits
         etc...
  > list of webpages with most unique page views also ordered
     e.g.:
         /about/2   8 unique views
         /index     5 unique views
         etc...

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'parser'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install parser

## Usage

```$ parser <logfile>``

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
